# From atoms to bits

As Nicholas Negroponte wrote, “The change from atoms to bits is irrevocable and unstoppable.” [Negroponte96] From today’s perspective, when this book was published, we were as yet on the eve of the information age. However, trends since then bear out his assertions. **Atoms**, in this case, refer to traditional information dissemination media (e.g., paper, CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, etc.), which, because of their inherent physical properties, require large amount of effort to be transported and preserve persistently. As an alternative carrier of information, **bits** are free from space and time constraints, and although they must eventually be stored in physical media, the information becomes readily accessible and easier to replicate. Even after numerous times accessing, the data will not be destroyed or lost.

In fact, digitalization has become ubiquitous in our lives, and it never ceases expanding. According to a white paper published by IDC (International Data Corporation) [IDC18], the annual size of the global digital datasphere grew from 2 ZB (Zettabyte) in 2010 to 33 ZB in 2018 and is predicted to reach 175 ZB by 2025.
With the raging tide of digitization, practitioners of informatics should have a clear understanding of the significance of digitization and the value and impact it brings to our real world. This essay will analyze the importance of digitization in three domains: data storage, information exchange, and roles for specific industries.

## Significance for data storage

Digital data is easy to create and replicate for backup and to avoid losing crucial data. Archivists can use RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) [Patterson88] to create redundant data backups. Duplicate copies of digital files are a reproduction that is identical to the original with the same number of bits, which is not practical for physical archives; there is no way to obtain a document with the same atomic composition as the original.

Another appealing point is that digital data itself will not age, excluding the wear and tear of the medium used to store it, which means that digitized data can persist and be stored permanently. Moreover, digital data generally requires much less physical space to store and less time to retrieve [Wallack08].
Besides, lossless compression (e.g., run length encoding, Hoffman coding, etc.), as well as lossy compression algorithms (such as discrete cosine transform), can allow the volume of digital data to be further reduced to compensate for the lack of network bandwidth [Kavitha16], which also propels the progress of digitalization.

Overall, digitization has enabled the storage of information and archives to become more convenient and reliable, light and swift, which positively affects handling an immense and growing volume of data.

## Significance for information exchange

Thanks to digitalization, the time cost of information transmission has been significantly reduced.
Conventional letters are gradually being replaced by emails and social media or instant messaging applications.

Additionally, the importance of digitalization was highlighted in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, when real-time online meetings attended by employees working from home in various locations became the solution for most companies. According to Dean, 3.3 trillion minutes of web meetings are hosted on Zoom in the year 2020 [Dean21].

Because of the features of digital data, the distribution and dissemination of information have also become effortless. This has further led to the establishment of digital literature libraries and museums where information has become more accessible [Fane20], enabling information to be transferred to the public rapidly.

Error detection and correction techniques (such as Reed-Solomon and Hamming codes [Chukwuma15]), as well as the use of asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) [RSA78], have made the transmission of information over channels more secure and reliant. Furthermore, digital information has rendered the IoT (Internet of Everything) a reality, and the era of the Internet of Everything is no longer far away with the contribution it will make. Today, for instance, it is easy to turn off the light using the Alexa voice assistant [Alexa21].

## Significance for specific industries

In this section, the role and value of digitalization in the agriculture, business, transportation, and healthcare industries will be analyzed, respectively.

In agricultural production, sensors can be installed in the vicinity of crops or livestock to collect relevant information for more timely or accurate decisions. Klerkx et al. maintain that digitalization is a revolutionary force in agricultural production [Klerkx19].

We can observe that manual accounting is being displaced by its paperless equivalent one in terms of the commercial sector, granting organizations improved quality and accessibility [Nonye18]. On the dimension of monetary policy, the People's Bank of China commenced the testing of their CDBC (Central Bank Digital Currency) e-CNY in early 2020, heralding the advent of the digital economic epoch, and it is anticipated to be employed to curb suspicious financial activities such as illicit transactions and money laundering [Li21].

Concerning the transportation industry, high-precision digital GIS (Geographic Information System) maps [USCGIS19], wireless communication protocols in V2X (Vehicle to Everything) networks [Chanyoung20], the various sensors are an indispensable element behind the implementation of autonomous driving, and deep learning for object detection [Ayşeguel17] are all bit-based. 

Throughout the protracted Covid-19 epidemic, digitization has played an unprecedentedly important role in the healthcare industry. Collaboration between governments and technology companies has led to the development of GEAN (Google/Apple Exposure Notification API), using digital contact tracing to stifle the rapid spread of the virus among the population [Apple20]. What is more, virus mutations found around the world are being rapidly sequenced into BLAST data files and subsequently be shared at the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the GISAID database for worldwide medical scientists to conduct research or develop diagnostic testing and vaccines [Pachetti20], all of which are inextricably linked to the maturity of digital technology now available.

## Conclusion

In summary, the implications of digitalization are that it makes the exchange of information more agile and efficient, makes the sharing of and access to information and data more straightforward than ever, significantly enhances the efficiency of mutual communication, and boosts the productivity of the integral human society. Finally, in terms of data storage, digitalization also provides a durable storage solution that reduces the risk of data loss and the cost of storing information and data, allowing precious information or cultural heritage to be passed in digital form to future generations intact. 

While these merits are apparent, we need to be vigilant about the social issues and the challenges raised by digitalization. The digital divide may escalate the polarization of society, thereby incurring an inequitable allocation of social resources. The ease of copying digital files can be a breeding ground for piracy, and centralized data storage can be an emblem of data monopolies and isolated data island phenomena. Malicious cyber-attacks will threaten the data security and privacy of Internet users. As computer scientists, we should be more prepared to tackle these potential looming menaces rather than sailing meekly into uncharted waters.
